# technology for efficient growth of plants
 an IoT project which consists of reading the values from sensors and perform few operartions like watering plant , turning fans on/off and turing on/off the lights and then send sensor to firebase , retrive data on anrdoid app!
 Working with this project
 - download the required libraries to run the code on arduino ide successfully
 - i have coded for dht22 , soil moisture , ldr sensors , feel free to use any other sensors and change code accordingly
 - i have used arduino uno to read sensor values , perform relay operations and node mcu to send data to firebase
 - i have attached java and res file for android app , find the same in andriod directory
 - to integrate firebase to your andriod project refer few youtube vedios / firebase documentation 
 - feel free to drop any doubts at comments section
 enjoy coding!
